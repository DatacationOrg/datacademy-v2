    "You will be working with a real-world data set, that is collected by a `digital auction house`. <br>\n",
    "As a data professional, your task is to use this data to improve the process of the auction house. <br>\n",
    "The data consist of three related tables: `auctions`, `lots` and `bids`. <br>\n",
    "Auctions concern the actual events at which lots (items) are auctioned, after which the bids table contains all bids placed. <br>\n",
    "A more detailed overview of what these tables are comprised of is given below:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Table `auctions` with columns:\n",
    "   * `id`: the auction id, uniquely identifying an auction (`int`).\n",
    "   * `relatedCompany`: the concerning company for which the items will be auctioned (`str`).\n",
    "   * `auctionStart`: the date and time at which the auction started (`datetime.date`).\n",
    "   * `auctionEnd`: the date and time at which the auction ended (`datetime.date`).\n",
    "   * `branchCategory`: the branch to which the product to be auctioned are categorized (`str`).\n",
    "2. Table `lots` with columns:\n",
    "   * `countryCode`: description of the country the lot is auctioned in (`str`).\n",
    "   * `saleDate`: the date and time at which the lot is sold (`datetime.date`).\n",
    "   * `auctionID`: the id reference of the auction at which the lot is offered (`int`).\n",
    "   * `lotNr`: the numeric indicator of the lot within its auction (`int`). \n",
    "   * `suffix`: additional information to the lot number (`str`).\n",
    "   * `numberOfItems`: the number of items offered within the lot (`float`).\n",
    "   * `buyerAccountID`: the id of the bidder who won the auction and bought the lot (`float`).\n",
    "   * `estimatedValue`: the estimated value of the items comprising the lot (`float`).\n",
    "   * `StartingBid`: the initial price for which the lot is offered (`float`).\n",
    "   * `reserveBid`: the minimum amount that the seller will accept as the winning bid (`int`).\n",
    "   * `currentBid`: the actual bid offered for the auctioned lot (`float`).\n",
    "   * `vat`: the percentage tax payed for the auctioned lot (`int`).\n",
    "   * `category`: the category of products to which this lot is assigned (`str`).\n",
    "   * `sold`: indicator whether the lot is sold or is left unsold (`int`).\n",
    "3. Table `bids` with columns:\n",
    "   * `auctionID`: the id reference of the auction at which the lot is offered (`int`).\n",
    "   * `lotNr`: the numeric indicator of the lot in which the bid is made (`int`).\n",
    "   * `lotID`: reference ID describing the lot in which the bid is made (`int`).\n",
    "   * `isCombination`: indicator if the bid is considered within a combination of bids (`int`).\n",
    "   * `accountID`: the id of the bidder who placed the bid (`int`).\n",
    "   * `isCompany`: indicator whether the bidder concerns a company (`int`).\n",
    "   * `bidPrice`: the price the bidder offered (`int`).\n",
    "   * `biddingDateTime`: the time the bid was placed by the bidder (`datetime.date`).\n",
    "   * `closingDateTime`: the time the lot is planned to close(`datetime.date`).\n",

    "To put our model to use, we will integrate it into the `API` which enables the user to create a lot. When a new lot is created a fundamental step is to decide the `starting price` of the auctioned lot. To make this data driven, your task is to implement the prediction model to automatically set an optimal price. This is done through `incrementally` increasing the starting bid until the lot prediction of the lot goes from sold to unsold. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Implementing the automation of the starting bid is of course hugely `simplified`, as it acquiesces on the assumption that a higher starting bid will result in a higher final bid. However, for the sole purpose of deploying an AI model it suffices. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "To execute this assignment, go to the directory called `app` and open the python file `Services`. Here you need to change the functionality of the `create_lot()` function. Within this function some basis code is already given (which you have to uncomment), to get you up to speed."
