    "You completed all modules and created all queries that are requested! <br>\n",
    "Through running other queries you are able to validate whether the queries you have written are correct. <br>\n",
    "However, to have a final check, we build in a mechanism that will check whether your queries show the desired, requested behavior. <br>\n",
    "To kick off these tests, you only have to push this directory to the main Git branch. <br>\n",
    "This can be done using the following steps:\n",
    "<ol>\n",
    "    <li> Open the command prompt in VS Code by pressing <b>CTRL</b> + <b>`</b>. </li>\n",
    "    <li> Write the command <code>git status</code> to check which differences there are between your current and the master branch. </li>\n",
    "    <li> Write the command <code>git add .\\Modules\\M3_SQL\\</code> to add the main notebook to the staging lane. </li>\n",
    "    <li> Write the command <code>git commit -m \"<i>[INSERT COMMIT MESSAGE]</i>\"</code> to commit the staged changes and adding a descriptive commit message. </li>\n",
    "    <li> Finally, write the command <code>git push</code> to push the staged changes to the master branch. </li>\n",
    "    <li> \n",
    "        Upon pushing the changes, the PyTest modules will be run to check your answers, for which an overview is generated in your Github \n",
    "        <ol>\n",
    "            <li> View the results by heading to Github.com, open your forked repository and go to Actions. </li>\n",
    "            <li> Upon first opening the Actions page it can be that you have to enable it first, if so just press \"I understand my workflows, go ahead and enable them\" button. </li>\n",
    "            <li> Within the <b>\"All workflows\"</b> frame you will find a workflow run that has the same name as the commit message used to push your answers. </li>\n",
    "            <li> \n",
    "                In front of  the workflow there can be either one of three things:\n",
    "                <ul>\n",
    "                    <li> <b>A yellow circle</b> - Meaning that the tests are still running. </li>\n",
    "                    <li> <b>A green check mark</b> - Meaning that all tests were successful and your code is written perfectly! </li>\n",
    "                    <li> <b>A red cross</b> - Meaning that a mistake is found within your code. </li>\n",
    "                </ul>\n",
    "            </li>\n",
    "            <li> You can open the workflow run to view the details by clicking on the name of the workflow run (which is the commit message you wrote). </li>\n",
    "            <li> After opening the workflow run, you can go to the details by clicking the white box that contains the mark and the text <b>\"run\"</b>. </li>\n",
    "            <li> If a red cross is shown, meaning there is a mistake, the mistake can be found by navigating to (and opening) the <b>\"PyTest\"</b> section. </li>\n",
    "            <li> Below the <b>\"____test_results____\"</b> you can find the <b>\"AssertionError:\"</b> which shows you where in your code the (first) mistake can be found and what the mistake is. </li>\n",
    "            <li> For example the code: <code>AssertionError: R_B3: ...</code> means that there is a mistake in Query B3. </li>\n",
    "        </ol>\n",
    "    </li>\n",
    "    <li> If a mistake was found, you head back to your code, fix the mistake using the hint shown behind the <b>AssertionError</b> and push your answers again. This will kickstart another test round. </li>\n",
    "</ol>\n",
    "If you pass all tests, feel free to continue to our next module, <b>Module 4 : Machine Learning (ML)</b>.\n",
