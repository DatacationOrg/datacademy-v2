    "So far we created a simplistic prediction model and a database containing our data. <br>\n",
    "We also build APIs to communicate with our database, which also allow for the creation of new auctions, lots and bids <br>\n",
    "Our next task is to deploy our prediction model in the creation of a lot. <br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "When a new lot is created a fundamental step is to decide the starting price of the auctioned lot. <br>\n",
    "To make this data driven, your task is to implement the prediction model to automatically set an optimal price. <br>\n",
    "This is done through incrementally increasing the starting bid until the lot prediction of the lot goes from sold to unsold. <br>\n",
    "Implementing the automation of the starting bid is of course hugely simplified, as it acquiesces on the assumption that a higher starting bid will result in a higher final bid. <br>\n",
    "However, for the sole purpose of deploying an AI model it suffices. <br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "To execute this assignment, go to the directory called \"app\" and open the python file \"Services\". <br>\n",
    "Here you need to change the functionality of the <code>create_lot()</code> function. <br>\n",
