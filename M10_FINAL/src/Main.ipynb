    "# Final Assignment: Datacademy - Auction data\n",
    "You will be working with a real-world data set, that is collected by a `digital auction house`. <br>\n",
    "As a data professional, your task is to use this data to improve the process of the auction house. <br>\n",
    "The data consist of three related tables: `auctions`, `lots` and `bids`. <br>\n",
    "Auctions concern the actual events at which lots (items) are auctioned, after which the bids table contains all bids placed. <br>\n",
    "A more detailed overview of what these tables are comprised of is given below:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Table `auctions` with columns:\n",
    "   * `id`: the auction id, uniquely identifying an auction (`int`).\n",
    "   * `relatedCompany`: the concerning company for which the items will be auctioned (`str`).\n",
    "   * `auctionStart`: the date and time at which the auction started (`datetime.date`).\n",
    "   * `auctionEnd`: the date and time at which the auction ended (`datetime.date`).\n",
    "   * `branchCategory`: the branch to which the product to be auctioned are categorized (`str`).\n",
    "2. Table `lots` with columns:\n",
    "   * `countryCode`: description of the country the lot is auctioned in (`str`).\n",
    "   * `saleDate`: the date and time at which the lot is sold (`datetime.date`).\n",
    "   * `auctionID`: the id reference of the auction at which the lot is offered (`int`).\n",
    "   * `lotNr`: the numeric indicator of the lot within its auction (`int`). \n",
    "   * `suffix`: additional information to the lot number (`str`).\n",
    "   * `numberOfItems`: the number of items offered within the lot (`float`).\n",
    "   * `buyerAccountID`: the id of the bidder who won the auction and bought the lot (`float`).\n",
    "   * `estimatedValue`: the estimated value of the items comprising the lot (`float`).\n",
    "   * `StartingBid`: the initial price for which the lot is offered (`float`).\n",
    "   * `reserveBid`: the minimum amount that the seller will accept as the winning bid (`int`).\n",
    "   * `currentBid`: the actual bid offered for the auctioned lot (`float`).\n",
    "   * `vat`: the percentage tax payed for the auctioned lot (`int`).\n",
    "   * `category`: the category of products to which this lot is assigned (`str`).\n",
    "   * `sold`: indicator whether the lot is sold or is left unsold (`int`).\n",
    "3. Table `bids` with columns:\n",
    "   * `auctionID`: the id reference of the auction at which the lot is offered (`int`).\n",
    "   * `lotNr`: the numeric indicator of the lot in which the bid is made (`int`).\n",
    "   * `lotID`: reference ID describing the lot in which the bid is made (`int`).\n",
    "   * `isCombination`: indicator if the bid is considered within a combination of bids (`int`).\n",
    "   * `accountID`: the id of the bidder who placed the bid (`int`).\n",
    "   * `isCompany`: indicator whether the bidder concerns a company (`int`).\n",
    "   * `bidPrice`: the price the bidder offered (`int`).\n",
    "   * `biddingDateTime`: the time the bid was placed by the bidder (`datetime.date`).\n",
    "   * `closingDateTime`: the time the lot is planned to close(`datetime.date`).\n",
    "\n",
    "Good luck!"

Based on our Descriptive Analysis, we see no clear indication for outliers in the `auction` and `bids` data frame. However, the `lots` data frame did contain some inconsistencies in the `estimatedValue` and `currentBid` columns. These columns both contain negative values, which is of course incorrect looking at the meaning of these columns. Also, the `category` column contains 'Unknown' values, which concern missing values which need to be dealt with accordigly.

    "After clustering (which is unsupervised learning) we are now going to apply supervised learning in the form of forecasting. To improve the auction platform we want to automate the decision about what the starting bid should be. For this, we will use a prediction model which predicts if a product will be sold. By increasing the starting bid iteratively and continuously checking if a product will be sold, we can define a breaking point. This breaking point is where the product goes from a sold prediction to an unsold prediction, which shows the highest starting bid which will result in a sell. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "This use case is of course greatly simplified, as the assumption that a higher starting bid will result in a higher final bid is quite a big one. But for the sole purpose of testing whether you understand the fundamentals of supervised learning it will suffice. What we want you to do is the following:\n",
    "* `Merge & Preprocess`: Manually prepare auctions and lots data set and build a `preprocessing pipeline`; <br>\n",
    "* `Train/Test split`: Split the lots data set into a 70/30 train/test split <b>(with `random_state=0`!)</b>; <br>\n",
    "* `Initialize models`: Initialize both the `LogisticRegression` and `RandomForestClassifer` using defaul settings and `random_state=0`; <br>\n",
    "* `Train models`: Train both models on the train set using `.fit(X, y)`; <br>\n",
    "* `Predict`: Use the trained model to predict the labels of the test set using `.predict(X, y)`; <br>\n",
    "* `Evaluate models`: Evaluate the performance of the models using the `accuracy` and plot the `confusion matrix`; <br>\n",
    "* `Save`: Save the best performing model to a `model.pkl` file for later usage; <br>\n",
