    "# Final Assignment: Datacademy - Auction data\n",
    "You will be working with a real-world data set, that is collected by a `digital auction house`. <br>\n",
    "As a data professional, your task is to use this data to improve the process of the auction house. <br>\n",
    "The data consist of three related tables: `auctions`, `lots` and `bids`. <br>\n",
    "Auctions concern the actual events at which lots (items) are auctioned, after which the bids table contains all bids placed. <br>\n",
    "A more detailed overview of what these tables are comprised of is given below:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Table `auctions` with columns:\n",
    "   * `id`: the auction id, uniquely identifying an auction (`int`).\n",
    "   * `relatedCompany`: the concerning company for which the items will be auctioned (`str`).\n",
    "   * `auctionStart`: the date and time at which the auction started (`datetime.date`).\n",
    "   * `auctionEnd`: the date and time at which the auction ended (`datetime.date`).\n",
    "   * `branchCategory`: the branch to which the product to be auctioned are categorized (`str`).\n",
    "2. Table `lots` with columns:\n",
    "   * `countryCode`: description of the country the lot is auctioned in (`str`).\n",
    "   * `saleDate`: the date and time at which the lot is sold (`datetime.date`).\n",
    "   * `auctionID`: the id reference of the auction at which the lot is offered (`int`).\n",
    "   * `lotNr`: the numeric indicator of the lot within its auction (`int`). \n",
    "   * `suffix`: additional information to the lot number (`str`).\n",
    "   * `numberOfItems`: the number of items offered within the lot (`float`).\n",
    "   * `buyerAccountID`: the id of the bidder who won the auction and bought the lot (`float`).\n",
    "   * `estimatedValue`: the estimated value of the items comprising the lot (`float`).\n",
    "   * `StartingBid`: the initial price for which the lot is offered (`float`).\n",
    "   * `reserveBid`: the minimum amount that the seller will accept as the winning bid (`int`).\n",
    "   * `currentBid`: the actual bid offered for the auctioned lot (`float`).\n",
    "   * `vat`: the percentage tax payed for the auctioned lot (`int`).\n",
    "   * `category`: the category of products to which this lot is assigned (`str`).\n",
    "   * `sold`: indicator whether the lot is sold or is left unsold (`int`).\n",
    "3. Table `bids` with columns:\n",
    "   * `auctionID`: the id reference of the auction at which the lot is offered (`int`).\n",
    "   * `lotNr`: the numeric indicator of the lot in which the bid is made (`int`).\n",
    "   * `lotID`: reference ID describing the lot in which the bid is made (`int`).\n",
    "   * `isCombination`: indicator if the bid is considered within a combination of bids (`int`).\n",
    "   * `accountID`: the id of the bidder who placed the bid (`int`).\n",
    "   * `isCompany`: indicator whether the bidder concerns a company (`int`).\n",
    "   * `bidPrice`: the price the bidder offered (`int`).\n",
    "   * `biddingDateTime`: the time the bid was placed by the bidder (`datetime.date`).\n",
    "   * `closingDateTime`: the time the lot is planned to close(`datetime.date`).\n",
    "\n",
    "Good luck!"

Based on our Descriptive Analysis, we see no clear indication for outliers in the `auction` and `bids` data frame. However, the `lots` data frame did contain some inconsistencies in the `estimatedValue` and `currentBid` columns. These columns both contain negative values, which is of course incorrect looking at the meaning of these columns. Also, the `category` column contains 'Unknown' values, which concern missing values which need to be dealt with accordigly.

To improve the auction platform we want to automate the decision about what the starting bid should be. For this, we will use a prediction model which predicts if a product will be sold. By increasing the starting bid iteratively and continuously checking if a product will be sold, we can define a breaking point. This breaking point is where the product goes from a sold prediction to an unsold prediction, which shows the highest starting bid which will result in a sell. <br>\n",

    "To put our model to use, we will integrate it into the `API` which enables the user to create a lot. When a new lot is created a fundamental step is to decide the `starting price` of the auctioned lot. To make this data driven, your task is to implement the prediction model to automatically set an optimal price. This is done through `incrementally` increasing the starting bid until the lot prediction of the lot goes from sold to unsold. <br>\n",

    "\n",
    "To execute this assignment, go to the directory called `app` and open the python file `Services`. Here you need to change the functionality of the `create_lot()` function. Within this function some basis code is already given (which you have to uncomment), to get you up to speed."
